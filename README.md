# Train App üöû

This project is a web-based platform designed to manage train trips. It includes role-based access for anonymous users, authorized users, and resource managers, each with unique responsibilities. The platform enables streamlined scheduling, booking, and trip management. The project is designed as a final part of the Angular course from [RS School](https://rs.school/).
